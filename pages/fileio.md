# Program Deployment

## Understanding .NET components
- **Language compilers:** These turn your source code written with languages C# into intermediate language (IL) code stored in assemblies.
With C# 6.0 and later, Microsoft switched to an open source rewritten compiler known as **Roslyn** that is also used by Visual Basic.

- **Common Language Runtime (CLR):** This runtime loads assemblies, compiles
the IL code stored in them into native code instructions for your computer's CPU, and
executes the code within an environment that manages resources such as threads and
memory.

- **NuGet Packages:** NuGet is the package manager for .NET. [Doc](https://www.nuget.org/ )

- **Package Manager:** A package manager or package-management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer in a consistent manner.
